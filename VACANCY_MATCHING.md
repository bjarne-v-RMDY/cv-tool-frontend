# Vacancy Matching System (Epic E3)

## Overview
This feature allows you to upload vacancy/job requirement documents, which are analyzed by AI to extract structured requirements. The system then automatically finds and ranks matching candidates using Azure AI Search with vector embeddings.

## Architecture

### Frontend
- **Page**: `/dashboard/vacancies`
  - File upload interface for vacancy documents (PDF/TXT)
  - List of all vacancies with key details
  - Click-through to detailed vacancy view

- **Page**: `/dashboard/vacancies/[id]`
  - Vacancy details with full requirements breakdown
  - Automatically matched candidates ranked by relevance
  - Click-through to candidate profiles

### Backend APIs

#### 1. **GET `/api/vacancies`**
- Fetches all vacancies from the database
- Includes requirement counts for each vacancy
- Ordered by creation date (newest first)

#### 2. **POST `/api/vacancies/upload`**
- Accepts: FormData with PDF/TXT files
- Uploads files to Azure Blob Storage (`vacancy-files` container)
- Adds messages to processing queue (`vacancy-processing-queue`)
- Returns upload results and errors

#### 3. **GET `/api/vacancies/[id]/match`**
- Fetches vacancy details and requirements
- Generates search query from requirements
- Uses Azure AI Search with vector embeddings to find matching candidates
- Returns ranked list of matching candidates with scores

### Azure Function

**`vacancyProcessing`**
- Triggered by: `vacancy-processing-queue`
- Downloads file from blob storage
- Extracts text (PDF or plain text)
- Uses Azure OpenAI to extract structured data:
  - Vacancy details (title, client, description, location, duration, budget)
  - Requirements with types, priority, and required/optional flags
- Stores in database:
  - `ProjectAssignments` table (vacancy details)
  - `AssignmentRequirements` table (individual requirements)
- Logs all activities

## Database Schema

### ProjectAssignments Table (Vacancies)
```sql
CREATE TABLE ProjectAssignments (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    Title NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    Description NVARCHAR(MAX),
    Client NVARCHAR(100),
    Duration NVARCHAR(100),
    Location NVARCHAR(100),
    RemoteWork BIT DEFAULT 0,
    StartDate DATE,
    Budget NVARCHAR(100),
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    UpdatedAt DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE()
);
```

### AssignmentRequirements Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE AssignmentRequirements (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY IDENTITY(1,1),
    AssignmentId INT NOT NULL,
    RequirementType NVARCHAR(50), -- 'Technology', 'Role', 'Experience', 'Language', 'Certification', 'Soft Skill'
    RequirementValue NVARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    IsRequired BIT DEFAULT 1,
    Priority INT DEFAULT 1, -- 1=High, 2=Medium, 3=Low
    CreatedAt DATETIME2 DEFAULT GETUTCDATE(),
    FOREIGN KEY (AssignmentId) REFERENCES ProjectAssignments(Id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## AI-Powered Matching

### How It Works

1. **Requirement Extraction** (AI Analysis)
   ```
   Vacancy Document → Azure OpenAI → Structured Requirements
   ```
   - Extracts all requirements from vacancy document
   - Categorizes into types: Technology, Role, Experience, Language, Certification, Soft Skill
   - Determines if each requirement is required or nice-to-have
   - Assigns priority (High/Medium/Low)

2. **Search Query Generation**
   ```
   Vacancy + Requirements → Combined Search Text → Embedding Vector
   ```
   - Combines vacancy title, description, and all requirements
   - Generates embedding using Azure OpenAI embeddings model
   - Creates semantic representation of ideal candidate

3. **Vector Search**
   ```
   Query Vector → Azure AI Search → Ranked Candidates
   ```
   - Searches the `cv-candidates` index using vector similarity
   - Finds candidates whose profiles semantically match the requirements
   - Returns top 20 matches ranked by relevance score

4. **Results Display**
   ```
   Candidates → UI with Match Scores → Click to View Profile
   ```
   - Shows candidate name, email, seniority, experience, location
   - Displays match score (0-100%)
   - Shows relevant skills that match requirements
   - Provides click-through to full candidate profile

### Requirement Types

| Type | Examples | Used For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Technology** | "React", "Python", "Docker", "AWS" | Technical skills matching |
| **Role** | "Senior Developer", "Team Lead" | Position/seniority alignment |
| **Experience** | "5+ years", "startup experience" | Experience level matching |
| **Language** | "English", "Dutch", "French" | Communication requirements |
| **Certification** | "AWS Certified", "Scrum Master" | Professional certifications |
| **Soft Skill** | "Leadership", "Communication" | Non-technical capabilities |

### Priority Levels

| Priority | Meaning | Use Case |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **High (1)** | Critical/Must-have | Core requirements for the role |
| **Medium (2)** | Important | Significant but not deal-breakers |
| **Low (3)** | Nice-to-have | Bonus qualifications |

## Deployment

### 1. Deploy Next.js Application
```bash
# From project root
pnpm install
pnpm run build
# Deploy to your hosting platform
```

### 2. Deploy Azure Functions
```bash
cd azure
npm install
npm run build
func azure functionapp publish <your-function-app-name>
```

### 3. Azure Storage Setup
Ensure these resources exist (auto-created on first upload):
- **Blob Container**: `vacancy-files`
- **Queue**: `vacancy-processing-queue`

### 4. Environment Variables
Same as existing setup - no new variables required!

## Usage Guide

### Uploading a Vacancy

1. **Navigate to Vacancies page**
   - Click "Vacancies" in the sidebar

2. **Upload vacancy document**
   - Drag and drop or select PDF/TXT file
   - File should contain:
     - Job title and description
     - Client/company information
     - Required skills and technologies
     - Experience requirements
     - Location and duration details
   - Click "Upload" button

3. **Processing**
   - File is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage
   - Azure Function automatically processes the file
   - Vacancy appears in list within 30-60 seconds

### Finding Matching Candidates

1. **View vacancies list**
   - All vacancies appear on main page
   - Shows title, client, location, duration, requirements count

2. **Click on a vacancy**
   - Opens detail page with full vacancy information
   - Requirements are automatically displayed and categorized
   - System automatically searches for matching candidates

3. **Review matches**
   - Candidates are ranked by match score
   - Higher scores indicate better matches
   - Click on any candidate to view their full profile

## Monitoring & Troubleshooting

### Activity Log Tracking

You'll see these entries in the Activity Log:

1. **"Vacancy File Uploaded"** - File received
2. **"Vacancy File Queued for Processing"** - Queued for AI analysis
3. **"Vacancy Processing Started"** - Analysis in progress
4. **"Vacancy Processing Completed"** - Vacancy and requirements stored

### Common Issues

**1. No matching candidates found**
- ✅ **Solution**: Ensure candidates are indexed (check Activity Log for "Indexing Completed")
- ✅ **Tip**: Requirements may be too specific - try adjusting the vacancy document
- ✅ **Note**: Search requires at least some candidates in the index

**2. Processing hangs**
- ✅ Check Azure Function logs
- ✅ Verify Azure OpenAI credentials
- ✅ Ensure queue exists and is accessible

**3. Low match scores**
- ✅ This is normal - not all candidates will be perfect matches
- ✅ Scores > 70% are excellent matches
- ✅ Scores 50-70% are good potential candidates
- ✅ Scores < 50% may require more evaluation

## Technical Details

### Search Algorithm

The matching system uses **hybrid semantic search**:

1. **Vector Embeddings**
   - Both vacancy requirements and candidate profiles are converted to vector embeddings
   - Uses Azure OpenAI `text-embedding-ada-002` model
   - 1536-dimensional vectors capture semantic meaning

2. **Cosine Similarity**
   - Azure AI Search calculates similarity between query and candidate vectors
   - Returns relevance score (0.0 to 1.0)
   - Higher scores indicate better semantic matches

3. **Ranking**
   - Candidates sorted by relevance score
   - Top 20 results returned
   - Scores converted to percentages for display (0-100%)

### Performance

- **Upload**: Instant (< 1 second)
- **Processing**: 30-60 seconds (depends on document size)
- **Matching**: 1-3 seconds (real-time search)
- **Scalability**: Handles hundreds of vacancies and thousands of candidates
